## Objective
The objective of this test is to build an API that does simple CRUD operations.

## Tasks
1. Create endpoint /news with the 4 basic operations: Create, Read, Update and Delete.
2. News should have the following attributes: id (int), title (string), author_id (int), article (string), is_published (bool)
3. The endpoint that returns the articles should accept pagination, basic filters and sorting.

## Suggestions
1. Feel free to use 3rd party packages if you feel it needs it.
2. Make sure you include all necessary files/settings to setup test environment. (migration files, configs, etc)
3. Do what you understand a "RESTful" API to be.
4. Make sure validation works on both creation and update.
5. Some Tests would be nice to see.

# Others
Once you are done, push it to your own repository and share the link in the the HR contact you've been speaking to.
